    <p class = text>The Antocratic Rosiyan Natsiya was founded September 29th, 1868 by Grotan Vlakov after being lost at sea with one hundred twenty other beings on the ship. Sixty percent of the people died before they even made it to the land. These people got onto a ship in order to escape the Crimean War's horrors. These people were ethnic Russian peasants living in Sevestopol, and they worked together to rent a boat to leave the country, as Russia was evidently losing the war and it wouldn't be good for them. They met their goal to buy a ship on January 4th, 1854, and immediately set off that evening. They were planning to reach Ellis Island, New York, in order to become American immigrants, but their fates were different.</p>

    <p class = text>After safely getting across the Mediteranean, the group expected the rest of their journey to only last three weeks, but it actually took fourteen years to get to their final destination. Storms and winds knocked them of course in 1856, delaying to trip by up to one year. Then, as if it was planned, strong waves and winds knocked over and killed eight people on the ship, and they were moving southwest instead of west, down the coast of Brazil. Soon, people started to suffer after starving and developing illnesses, as they ran out of food; the group never planned on spending more than a month or two on the ship. Five people were victims of starvation and six were to disease, mostly children and old people. Grotan Vlakov's daughter was born during this time (bad timing). After trading for food with the Brazilian people, the group decided to continue south in 1860, as they thought they would never make it back up. Soon, they reached Mary Byrd Land of Antarctica after going straight south, and Grotan decided to risk it and go through a subterranean river, naming it the River of Red Wine in 1861. This didn't end well, as thirteen people died of frostbite. The survivors started to lose hope, going through mental disorders. In 1863, explorers Kodkovich Loromog and Lenin Jonebergov scaled the terrain of Antarctica, after climbing above the river and they named it Zemlya Prosvetlenya, or Land of Enlightenment. Later it was called Illuminati’koa, or Land of Illumination. Soon, they redirected themselves and left the River of Red Wine, getting to Pivnaya Reka, or the Beer River. After leaving the Pivnaya Reka, they ended up getting to the coast of South Africa in 1867, and then hope came upon them. Maybe they could reside in Cape Town. But things didn’t go as planned, and the Storm of ‘67 killed nineteen people, the worst storm of all. What made it worse was that Grotan’s seven-year-old daughter Iva Grotanov, his father, and wife were three of the victims who died in the storm. Grotan went into depression, but on September 28th, 1868, he was back to normal when he found land for the first time in almost eight years.</p>

    <p class = text>The next day, Grotan and his best mate Petri Ekratus managed to safely bring the boat of sixty-seven other survivors to the island. Ekratus named it Originia, and worshiped the land, thanking life for giving him safe land after fourteen years of toil. When Grotan and Ekratus began the journey, they were thirteen, but now they spent more of their lives on the boat than on land; they were twenty-seven. After safely getting everyone on the island, Kodkovich Loromog realized that this was unclaimed territory, and informed Grotan. Then, Ekratus and Grotan agreed to become the oligarchs of the state, and named the nation Rusha, after their previous residence, on September 29th, 1868. During the next two years, the civilization of Originia flourished, and in 1870, Grotan discovered another island close by and named it Ivaland, after his dead daughter. However, this island was very barren, and people gave up on it. In 1872, Grotan had another daughter called Drovski Grotanov, and later that year the Rushans made their first contact with the Lanxans, who were the native peoples of this archipelago. In 1873, Ekratus decided to take interest in Ivaland and cultivated the land, by putting better soil, and founded a city there called Petrisburg.  It soon became the capital city in 1874, making everyone praise Ekratus for his work. This was the beginning of the end of Grotan and Ekratus’s friendship.</p>

    <p class= text>Later, attacks on Rusha took place by the natives in 1875, and Ekratus and some brave people from the civilization went to deal with it. Ekratus left with nineteen others, and came back with only two, a week after. Those two were Kodkovich Loromog and Anastasia Obnizov. That night, they were plotting a way to kill the leader of the natives for their own good, but Grotan, while passing by their camp, misunderstood and thought that they were plotting a way to kill himself, so that Ekratus would become the ruler. The next morning Grotan hired one of his citizens to act as a hitman, but that failed as Ekratus ended up killing the hitman. This caused Grotan and Ekratus to have an argument, and as a consequence Ekratus left along with Loromog and Obnizov, as well as a few Rushans that supported Ekratus (which was a lot because they all praised Ekratus for founding Petrisburg). Soon, they would create the country of Ekrane on July 29th, 1876. Meanwhile, Rusha was slowly failing, because without the expertise of Ekratus, and without the capital city of Petrisburg, there was no government order or a way to grow crops, and the Great Famine (Velgolod) began and lasted for a year. Many died, but soon Grotan was able to get things back to normal after founding another city called Originia City. In 1877, Grotan discovered what is now known as the Mainland. It was a vast land, but was teeming with Lanxans and other tribes. He made another settlement in the Northwest called Campville, and all was well for a couple years. In 1877, the Rushans took in seven Lanxans who apparently were outcasts. Their language blended with the Russian language, creating a new creole language called Rushan. In 1880, Grotan had another child, this time a son, called Kovich Grotanov. Kovich’s older sister was now eight years old. Realizing that there was currently no education system for children, Grotan established the first school in Campville in 1882. Rusha was thriving. The population went from 69 to half a thousand people in five years alone. In 1883, Russianese, the artistic form of Rushan, with actions representing words, was created. Also, Rushan was declared the official language of Rusha.</p>
    <p class = head>Te Tarshenye</p>
    <p class = text>On December 9th, 1885, Rusha <a href = "lanx.html">declared war on the Lanxans</a>, after they organized a military. They were fully prepared to win. And they were right; their first war was a success. Rusha acquired the entire western face of the mainland in only one year. The war ended on January 18th, 1887. Although Rusha got bigger, Ekrane still only consisted of Ivaland. Rusha founded the city of Mosbull, and Grotan claimed, “This will be our smallest city yet.” But he was wrong. As of 2023, the population of Mosbull is 12.21 million. In 1888, the Russian language was forgotten among the Rushans, as no one spoke it anymore. In 1889, nine-year-old Kovich contracted a mild form of polio, paralyzing his legs. He had to sit on a wheelchair for the rest of his life. In 1890, Grotan had some heart complications, and could not rule Rusha anymore. The Grotanov family had some bad luck. Lenin Jonebergov stepped in on August 4th, 1891 as temporary ruler of Rusha. In 1895, Rusha officially claimed Antarctica as part of its country, with the name Zemlya Prosvetlenya. In 1896, the Rushan syllabary was created, as another way of writing. Now, the three main writing systems of Rusha are Russianese, Syllabaric Rushan, and Traditional Rushan. In 1897, the first European explorer, Ludwig Müller, landed on Rusha. As they say, Europeans discover everything. And Lenin, being a native Russian, knew what the Europeans would do. Ludwig would go back to Germany and then the country would claim Rusha for themselves. Lenin knew he couldn’t let that happen, so he had Ludwig executed. There was a debate whether this was moral or not, and soon it got violent.</p>
    <p class = head>Te Vonye</p>
    <p class = text>This caused the <a href = "civi.html">First Civil War</a> on February 13th, 1898. One side was Lenin and his supporters, who were all for killing the Europeans. The other side was Trotsky Spielov and his supporters, who thought that they could join with the Europeans to create a bigger nation. Grotan had no say in this because he had heart problems. On January 1st, 1900 the war ended and Lenin won. However, to win back Trotsky’s supporters, he decided that they’ll make a concentration camp for the Europeans in Mineland, an island in the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s like a strainer. All the bad of the Europeans will go out, and the pure Europeans will join Rusha,” stated Lenin. Trotsky’s supporters then split into two. The first group decided to go with Lenin, and called themselves the Leninians. The others were still unhappy and called themselves the Trotskies. Although the war and Lenin’s words didn’t solve everything, things were still going good for Lenin and the Leninians. Lenin knew that none of the Europeans would ever make it through the concentration camp. However, Robert Fischer proved him wrong in 1904. The German accidentally landed on Mineland and survived the entire thing. After processing him he got to the mainland, became a Rushan citizen, and also had a daughter called Sybil Voloski in 1908. In 1902, the Krazh became the new currency of Rusha, and it was used for purchases, and in 1903, Vodka was reintroduced to Rusha. After almost fifty years of not drinking vodka, the Rushans got addicted to it. In 1905, the Iris Civilization was created in Illuminati, after creating a heat source the shape of an iris. It was groundbreaking. That same year, another civilization, called the Polaris Valley Civilization, was created, to prove that life can exist in Antarctica. However, one year later, on March 4th, 1906, the Second Civil War started after Lenin died after having a stroke at the age of seventy-six. Grotan was sixty-six, his son Kovich was twenty-six, and his daughter Drovski was thirty-four. Because Kovich was handicapped and Grotan wasn’t physically well, they didn’t get drafted for the Second Civil War. However, Drovski was, and she ended up sacrificing her life to save the country, and died in 1908. After hearing the news, Grotan went into depression again, for the second time. Soon, the war ended in 1910, and the concentration camps in Mineland ended temporarily. Kovich presumed the position as leader, and even prevented a third civil war in 1912. The Rushans loved him. However, there was one person who despised Kovich, and it was Stalin Vissarionovich. Stalin had him overthrown in 1916, and ruled for the next decade. He invaded Ekrane and starved half the population to death. This event caused tensions between the captured Ekranean government and Stalin’s. Petri Ekratus thought that this was Grotan’s doing, not knowing that Grotan was ill. A lot of Rushans also died during Stalin’s rule, and they were all glad that Stalin died of a stroke in 1926.
    <p class = head>Te Vodkæater</p>
    <p class = text>On April 21st, 1926, Kovich had twins: Korikius Kovichov and Astatos Kovichov. In 1928, at the age of two, Astatos was kidnapped by someone and was never seen in the immediate future. In 1929, Kovich succumbed to his polio and died at the age of fifty-one. Grotan raised Korikius from then on. The Rushans mourned his death as he was the best ruler yet. The Rushans decided that Korikius should become the new ruler of Rusha as soon as he turned sixteen, which was the age of adulthood in Rusha. However, Robert Fischer’s daughter, Sybil Voloski, wanted her own son, Bob Voloski to be the next ruler of Rusha and trained him to be a fighter so that he could kill Korikius to become ruler. Korikius didn’t know about this, but everyone around him, including his own grandfather, knew. In 1940, Grotan decided to set up an arena in Mosbull in which the two can fight. It turned out that more than one person decided to train to kill Korikius. There were ninety-nine others. On April 21st, 1942, on Korikius's birthday, the game began. It was a great massacre. In the end, there were three remaining: Bob Voloski, Korikius Kovichov, and Justin. Bob killed Justin, and was mortally wounded. Korikius finished the job, and he realized that the person he killed was not Bob. It was actually his own grandfather, Grotan, who was acting like Bob. Bob died a long time ago. This was Grotan, dead in his arms. But Korikius had to stay strong. On the next day, he was inaugurated as the ruler of Rusha. The first proposition he made is that instead of a violent game to chose the next ruler, there will be a more peaceful game. Whoever could manage to consume vodka by eating it would be the new 'Vodkæater.' He called himself the vodkæater, and ruled happily ever after. Until twenty-seven years later when he was assasinated by Justin's younger brother Karl on June 9th, 1969, a month before the fake space landing. Karl chose the wrong time to kill Korikius. If he did it only a month before, he would've still survived as death row was not established yet. He was executed via hanging on January 9th, 1970.</p>

    <p class = text>The first Vodkæater contest started on December 1st, 1969, in which Geoffery Laundon won. Laundon was a corrupt vodkæater, who reigned from 1969 to 1975 until he was eventually overthrown by the citizens. Because of this, the next vodkæater, Khazer Vask, made a law that the vodkæater contest should take place every five years so that the vodkæater won't go corrupt with power. A former vodkæater can still participate in the vodkæating contest, but it is very unlikely, as they always have to try a different method. After Khazer Vask, the next vodkæater was Rofson Zachrizgurg. However, he only served for one year before dying from a heart attack. The next vodkæater contest had no winners, so one of the backup governments took over. This was the first time that this happened. This government renamed the country to the Republic of Udia, which is a democratic country, which is different than the former antocratic country. However, Udia soon collapsed in 2001 after losing economic support from the citizens. The next vodkæater was Kyzhgiax Frykyulocor. Frykylocor had to deal with a war with Ekrane. In the 1920s Petri Ekratus taught his daughter, Simone Ekratus, to hate the country of Rusha because its former ruler, Grotan (but in truth it was Stalin, but the Ekraneans didn't know that), made Ekrane suffer. Simone was seventy years old, but her son, Markus Ekratus, was fourty. Markus decided to innitiate the war in 2002, when the Rushans were recovering from a democratic rule. Markus declared war on April 1st, 2002, creating the First Ruso-Ekranean War. However, the Rushan military was stronger than ever, and easily won the war, claiming Petrisburg as their own.</p>
