    <h1 class = fancy>The Three Civil Wars</h1>
    <p class = text>The Three Civil Wars are terrible wars that spanned from 1898-1982. The following will show a full description of these wars.</p>
    <p class = head>FIRST CIVIL WAR</p>
    <p class = text>The first civil war was started on February 13th, 1898, because of Lenin Jonebergov's controversial actions on the December of 1897 on the German Ludwig Müller. Just because he was an outisder, Lenin had him killed because he knew that the Müller would come back with European colonizers and take over Rusha. The people who supported him were called Leninists. Then, there was Trotsky Spielov, who opposed this killing act, believing that they could convert the Germans into loyal Rushans, leading to no bloodshed. The people who supported him were called Trotskies. At first it was minor arguments,, but over time it got violent between the two sides, making Lenin declare war. This was a different war: Civil War.</p>
    <p class = text>BATTLE OF MOSLANDIA</p>
    <p class = text>At 12:06 PM, five miles from the outskirts of Mosbull, The two sides attacked with swords, crossbows, and primitive muskets. The Leninist side strategically circled around them by 12:21 PM, and fired at them, every single on of the Trotskies dropping dead. This was the fastest battle ever started and ended by the Rushans: fifteen minutes. For another four months, there was silence, but rised tension and suspicion amongst the two sides. They acted like they were sworn enemies, although they were both from the same country. On May 28th, Southern Russia, or the People's Republic of Kaukasia, seceded from the rest of Rusha. This is the same government that rules the East Bay as of now. At this time, Rusha's territory only consisted of the western side of Mainland Rusha. Kaukasia received the states of Teliovia, Victoria, and Moslandia (exception for Mosbull).</p>
    <p class = text>BATTLE OF ROXAINA</p>
    <p class = text>At 1:09 AM on August 4th, 1898, the Kaukasian Troskies, with the help of the Ekraneans, were able to sneak down onto the island Roxaina, into the city of Casiño, Texas. After shooting down thirty drunk gamblers, the Rushan Leninists led the Kaukasians to an alleyway and dropped a grenade on them, killing half of them. The rest of them continued to fight, shooting more than half of the Leninists. It seemed like the Trotskies were about to win the battle. And they did. None of the brave Leninists survived the Battle of Roxaina. The Trotskies proudly marched their way back down to Kaukasia.</p>
