    <h1 class = fancy>The Ruso-Ekranean Wars</h1>
    <p class = text>The Ruso-Ekranean Wars are a series of four wars that spanned from 2002 to 2033. The following will show a full description of these wars.</p>
    <p class = head>FIRST RUSO-EKRANEAN WAR</p>
    <p class = text>The first Ruso-Ekranean War began on 2002, officiated by Markus the First of Ekrane because of a misunderstanding nearly ninety years ago by his maternal grandfather Peter Ekratus. When Stalin Vissarionovich created a famine in Ekrane, Ekratus believed that it was his former friend Grotan who caused this, not knowing that Grotan was sick and wasn't currently leader. This hate passed down to his daughter Simone Ekratus, but she couldn't do anything abour it because Rusha was stronger than ever. However, after the Third Civil War from 1978 to 1881, Rusha was weakened, and after vodkæater Rofson Zachrizgurg was assassinated during the war, and the government of Udia was replacing Rusha, Simone Ekratus' son Markus the First declared war as soon as Udia collapsed, and Rusha was at its weakest. At this time, Kyzhgiax Frykyulocor was vodkæater, but he was inexperienced, as he unintentionally became vodkæater.</p>
    <p class = text>BATTLE OF THE GREAT SELAKIAN GORGE</p>
    <p class = text>Ekranean forces from southeastern Ivaland sailed into the Rushan mainland on northwestern Selakia at 2:03 AM on August 1st, 2002. They raided nearby remote farms and homes, until the Rushan military stepped in on 2:32 AM. Knowing that this was not just a normal Ekranean pillage, General Visonich Totsky made his Rushan forces chase the Ekraneans into the nearby Great Selakian Gorge, by 3:19 AM. From there, the two sides started open fire, until there were only fifty or so Ekraneans at 4:28 AM. They surrendered, and the Rushans captured the remaining Ekraneans An Ekranean diplomat arrived at 6:58 AM after news spread that the Ekranean soldiers were held captive. They finally came to an agreement: If Rusha decided not to attack, and Ekrane didn't attack Western Rusha again, then Rusha could claim the southern part of Ivaland as their own. So, Rusha got all the land south of Saint Petrisburg, economic capital of Ekrane.</p>
    <p class = text>BATTLE OF ASTALA</p>
    <p class = text>Markus was angry about the loss, and soon, he decided to attack again, but on the eastern front. On January 9th, 2003, at 11:23 PM, Markus sent Ekranean forces to the small port country of Xol, which is the best way to attack Eastern Rusha without the Rushans knowing. After navigating down the streets of Xol, the Ekraneans managed to enter Rusha through the Rushan-Xol border in the province of Astala by 11:48 PM. From there, they went to the city of Astala and killed and bombed many innocent civillians. By 12:13 AM the Rushan military arrived and terminated all of the Ekraneans, as well as all of Ivaland, causing the country of Ekrane to go quiet for the next decade. On the upside, Rusha gained control of St. Petrisburg nad made it its economic capital.</p>
    <p class = head>SECOND RUSO-EKRANEAN WAR</p>
    <p class = text>After the Rushan Great Depression from 2005 to 2011, Markus seized the opportunity to declare another war on Rusha, as soon as Astatos Kovichov, Korikius Kovichov's twin sister's vodkæating term was over. When the war started, inexperienced Frafka Nazikov was the president. The reason she became the vodkæater was accidental, and she never wanted to rule. However, it happened, and what was worse was that she had to lead her country through the second Ruso-Ekranean War. Frafka Nazikov would experience the worst five years of Rushan history as soon as Markus attacked.
