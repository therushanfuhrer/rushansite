    <h1>Rosiyan Natsiya</h1>
    <p>Pledge of Allegiance</p>
    <p>Recite while holding a Roman Salute</p>
    <p>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the Antokasik Rosiyan Natsiya, and to the Antocracy for which it stands, one Nation under the vodkæater, invisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>
    <hr></hr>
    <h1 class = wtr>We the Rushans<h1>
    <p class = text>of the Antocratic Rosiyan Natsiya, in order to perform the actions of a perfect nation, establish justic, insure wild tranquilizers, provide a common fence, promote the general warfare, and secure the blessings of slavery and liberty to ourselves and our posterity, to ordain and establish this Kunstitusione for the Great Antokasik Rosiyan Natsiya.</p>
    <p class = text>Our civic virtues will never be abandoned, as they are the harvesting of habits important for the success of a society. It is the dedication of citizens to the common welfare of each other even at the cost of their own individual interest.</p>
    <p class = text>We as a society will live harmoniously alongside our four sibling nations, and we promise that we must mostly protect them from harm from outside nations, albeit the fact that they tried to harm us after seeking independence from us. The oldest of the four is the Nation of Ekrane, a democratic country founded by Petri Ekratus in 1896. The two that formed later in 1909 as reprecussions were Kaukasia and Krimia, once one nation, under the influence of Ekrane, located on the East Bay. The final country is the island nation of Xol, which is currently a communist nation. Altogether, the nations on the Grotanian Archipelago are called the Sheunasiones. And so, as we go forth in time, we will unite as one country under the rule of the Great Antocratic Rosiyan Union of Natsiyas, and one day together we can achieve world domination!</p>
    <p class = text>We go on for sure, but we cannot last as a society unless we follow the Kunstitusione. We have brought together this constitution in this document:
    <p class = head>ARTICLE I</p>
    <p class = text>There will be four official branches of government in the country of Rusha. The first will be defined as the Polnitive Branch, which consists of the Vodkæater and the Vodkabreather. The Vodkæater is the head of the country, and every five years a new term commences. The next leader is not dependant on a family member. There is no dynastical bloodlines in Rusha, as this nation isn't a mere monarchy or empire. Instead, it is determined by skill; a competition. If one finds a way to consume vodka by eating it, they will become the next ruler, and there has to be a different method every time. If everyone fails, meaning that no one manages to do it, then a backup takeover happens, known as a Takien. The last official Takien commenced in 1989, when the country went into a democracy for thirteen years and was identified as the country of Udia. A Vodkabreather is chosen by the Vodkæater.</p>
    <p class = head>ARTICLE II</p>
    <p class = text> So now, we will define the second and third branches of government. They are known as the Zakonive and and Zukidive branches. The Zakonive Branch contains the semi-legislative powers, and it consists of Kvasseaters and Kvassbreathers. The Kvasseaters remain in power for eight years before another new term starts. Their job is to carry out laws made by the Vodkæater. These Kvasseaters are elected by the Vodkabreather. There are twenty-one Kvasseaters, one for each state, and eighty-four Kvassbreathers, one for each district. Also, a Kvassbreather and a Vodkabreather have to inhale vaporized Kvass and Vodka respectively on their inauguration day. A Kvasseater appoints the four Kvassbreathers. of their state district. The Zukidive Branch consists of the Great Judges, who assess major criminals, and decide whether they should be put on death row, be freed, go to jail, or deemed as an elmo (slave) and either send them to Mineland or put them in the market. There are also minor Judges, who deal with petty crimes and conflicts. The Great and minor Judges corrospond the Kvasseaters and Kvasbreathers respectively. There are twenty-one Great Judges and eighty-four minor Judges. The term length of a Great Judge is twelve years, and they appoint with the four minor Judges.</p>
    <p class = head>ARTICLE III</p>
    <p class = text> The last branch of the government is the Lochodorive Branch in which the corroders reside in. The Korenthis is a group of the Corroders that are on a selected list. If their seniors elect them they can become a vodkabreather, kvassbreather, kvasseater, Great Judge, or minor Judge. In short, the Korenthis is just a group of Corroders who are future electees. The other Corroders are just random inexperienced politicians learning about politics. One can become a Corroder by advancing up the social classes, although that can take a very long time. The Korenthis's main job is to collect the opinions and feelings of the citizens and report it to the Vodkæater so that they can end the commotion.</p>
    <p class = head>ARTICLE IV</p>
    <p class = text>The twenty-one states of this Natsiya shall act together, as well as all three branches, to create the wonderful country of the Antokasik Rosiyan Natsiya. They shall not go against each other or create any more civil wars, as the past few have not ended well for our nation. This constitution will keep this country together by defining the rights of citizens as well as the rights of the politicians of the government. Any misunderstandings shall easily be resolved in a peaceful meet, and any revolutions will be frowned upon, and the state will face damages. Now, let all the states of Rusha follow the laws and constitution. Bless this country, and its people.</p>
    <p class = text>Now, we define the laws and the treatment of citizens, in the following Amendments.</p>
    <p class = head>1ST AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The first amendment of Rusha gives one a right to exist, and practice their own ideologies and religions, as long as the local minor Judge approves of it. However, there can be some exeptions. For example, the religion of Zoroastrianism or Zuckerbergism is already banned and it is illegal to follow them. There are a lot of others, but most religions and ideologies are generally accepted in the Great Rushan Natsiya.</p>
    <p class = head>2ND AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The second amendment entitles one a right to possess weaponry, to fight and possibly kill someone in the means of self-defense. If so, the criminal would face the charges of assault that the victim could have received. For example, if the victim burns down the criminal's house, the criminal is charged for arson, and not the victim. This law protects the basic human defense and the right to stay safe against a criminal. However, one cannot possess a nuclear weapon unless they have a permit, or are the vodkæater, as they are very destructive and expensive.</p>
    <p class = head>3RD AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The third amendment gives one a right to refuse to provide quarters for the military. In other words, the Rushan military cannot interfere with a citizen's life, and a citizen is not required to sacrifice their life for the country, or give housing to the military. This can possibly save a civilian's life on the long run, and it can affect them in a positive way. Although one doesn't need to provide quarters for the military, they must provide quarters for the vodkæater when needed.</p>
    <p class = head>4TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The fourth amendment entitles one a right to participate in becoming a vodkæater or moving up the social status regardless of their race, gender, orientation, or any other factor that can be discriminatory. This hence protects people from discrimination, and it proves that everyone has rights and they can be high in lfie without others telling them they cannot because of a discriminatory quality.</p>
    <p class = head>5TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The fifth amendment entitles one a right for a judge to deal with crime, and that it is illegal to incriminate one without the standard hearing by a judge. A regular inspection by the Kvassbreather regulates this and makes sure that all criminals are deemed as criminals through a standard hearing. This amendment also protects criminal records, and makes sure that criminals can erase their records by joining the Rushan Police Force.</p>
    <p class = head>6TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The sixth amendment ensures that taxes are carried out, and to make sure that every civilian and politician pay their taxes accordingly. This amendment makes sure that no one cheats the process of taxes, and that everyone pays to the kvassbreather. This amendment also ensures that the kvassbreathers gives fifty percent of their tax income to the kvasseaters, and the kvasseaters fourty percent to the vodkabreather, and the vodkabreather seventy percent to the Vodkæater. However, the Vodkæater can only use sixty percent of their income, meaning that fourty percent of the Krazh goes to the Great and Minor Judges, as well as the citizen’s welfare. Although the Judges do not make much in normal taxes, they make up for it in Judge Taxes and criminal fines. The Judges do not need to pay the vodkæater.</p>
    <p class = head>7TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The seventh amendment gives the government a right to commence a new order without the civilians' response. For example, a war may be started, taxes may increase, or the period of peace ends. However, all of these can be done without the citizen's decision, as long as the vodkæater and kvassbreathers go together and formally make the decision. But, the order can be vetoed if enough people petition against it.</p>
    <p class = head>8TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The eight amendment entitles one a right to be able to protest, petition, or boycott an order or topic without facing criminal charges. If enough people come together and stronglly oppose an order or topic, the government will seriously consider it without a doubt. This amendment applies only to order made without martial law.</p>
    <p class = head>9TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The ninth amendment makes sure that passports and documentations of a civilian belong to the government, and unlike a civilian's personal property, the civilian has to show a passport, license, or documentation when asked by a government official, or it is considered an illegal act and one can be charged with criminal activity and be interrogated about it. Essentially, the government has a right to identify who a civilian is and why they exist for what purpose.</p>
    <p class = head>10TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The tenth amendment provides and protects the rules that aren't numbered on the Kunstitutsion, which protects other sorts of things, and allows changes to be made o the Kunstitusione. Without the tenth amendment, one couldn't have changed the Kunstitusione, and that could have created a lot of problems. People could have suffered greatly, but thanks to fellow Grotan's nephew Rudolphus, who asked the others to add it when he was twenty-one, we the Rushans are safe.</p>
    <p class = head>11TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The eleventh amendment protects slaves, declaring that slaves, or Elmos, have to be fed two times a day, and that only criminals sentenced to it and Western European - South Slavic immigrants can become slaves. Also, slaves can only be put on the market on the official Government site, and doing business otherwise is illegal and can put one in prison or other charges like becoming a slave themselves or paying a lot of money, which is very undesirable. Slaves are now rightfully protected by the Rushan Kunstitusione.</p>
    <p class = head>12TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The twelfth amendment shows that the government system can change if a vodkæater is not selected. The Government that changes may vary. The recent one was Udia, which was democratic. There was also Ekratia, which was a communist regime that lasted nineteen years from 1926 to 1945, just before the Great Game when one hundred sixteen-year-olds fought to death for the throne, and just after Stalin Vissarionovich's rule. Also, criminals are not seen as citizens, and anything can be done to them and it will be legal, including regularly illicit things, such as torture, murder, rape, et cetera. </p>
    <p class = head>13TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The thirteenth amendment entitles one to the right to be able to take holidays, meaning that one has the freedom to take leaves and vacation breaks. However, one can only take leave for a maximum of five days every 2.5 months, or ten days per year, whatever their choice is. However, Elmos cannot take vacation unless their masters say so. One will be reminded the fact that slaves are owned by upperclassmen like corroders or opitors; so the Elmo slaves have no rights ubkess they are actually given them. Most likely slaves will not be doing that, so this amendment does not apply to them.</p>
    <p class = head>14TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The fourteenth amendment allows prohibition to happen. Prohibition is when all alcohol substances are illegal. However, Vodka and Wine is okay, and the limit is 1.5 gallons a day. If one drinks any more than that, they will be sentenced to death. Rusha is a growing country, but it certainly cannot be a drunk country. The limit of 1.5 gallons will fix everthing. Also, it is illegal to drink any alcoholic substance within forty-five minutes of driving a car.</p>
    <p class = head>15TH AMENDMENT</p>
    <p class = text>The fifteenth amendment symbolizes that all the amendments override local laws, meaning that a local law that says that beer is legal can be overridden by the fourteenth amendment, and the suspect can face criminal charges if in trial with Great Judges and most minor Judges, However, it is okay if consulted to some minor Judges from smaller local districts. This can sometimes be good for the person who is being charged, as sometimes state laws can be unfair to the citizens. Now, the citizens are safe, healthy, and protected. What an exquisite touch of Rusha, are we right? These beautiful amendments cannot be erased and they are only powerless during a government change or when something related to issues like that commences, which keeps the citizens nicely. This amendment is the most important amendment because it protects all the other amendments.</p>
    <p class = head>KUNSTITUSIONE KUNKLUSYA</p>
    <p class = text>As we end the Kunstitusione for the Antokasik Rosiyan Natsiya, we will talk about the future of this nation. The world is bereft of proper ethics, and no one will ever master it. No one will agree to everything, and it isn't always tolerable to do so.</p>
