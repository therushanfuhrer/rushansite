  <h3>The Three Seasons of Russia:</h3>
  <h3>BLEACH</h3>
  <p>Since Rusha is so close to the South Pole, it has less seasons than most countries. The first season is Bleach, which lasts from mid-March to mid-July. There is no known reason why this season is called Bleach. This season is almost the equivalent of autumn or spring. In the beginning of bleach (right after New Year's), you'll expect the harvest to end, and during the end, it basically snows but is counted as rain because it is too warm to be considered snow. This part is also called half-winter. The only reason this part isn't called winter is because of the warmth.</p>
  <h3>WINTER</h3>
  <p>Winter is cold and barren. Please help.</p>
  <h3>SUMMER</h3>
  <p>Summer provides relief after three long months of the cold. It begins in mid-December and ends in mid March, and it isn't too hot because of the latitude the country is at. At the end of summer is the beginning of harvest season.</p>
