    <h1>Bank of Rusha</h1>
    <p>The basic unit of currency in Rusha is the Krazh (plural: Krazh). The value of one Krazh is four United States Dollars. (328 INR, 94,630 VND, 3.60 EUR, 68 MXN, 5.30 CND.)</p>

    <p class = head>KRAZH COINS:</p>
    <p class = text>Piscel Coin</p>
    <p class = text>The Piscel is the lowest valued coin. On the front is an image of a bloated Mackerel Icefish, which is the national fish of Rusha, and on the back is a gun used for Rushan Roulette, a fun pastime game. A Piscle is worth one half of a Krazh, or two United States Dollars.</p>
    <p class = text>Septum Coin</p>
    <p class = text>The Septum is the second of the three coins. On the front is a blue spruce tree, which is the national tree of Rusha, and on the back is a picture of the first vodk√¶ater of Rusha, Korikius Kovichov. A Septum is worth one seventy-fifth of a Krazh, or three United States Dollars.</p>
    <p class = text>Krazh Coin</p>
    <p class = text>The Krazh is the highest valued coin. On the front is a symbol that is asssociated with the Illuminati Foundation created by the great Adam Weishaupt, and on the back is a picture of Weishaupt himself. A Krazh is worth one Krazh, of course, or four United States Dollars.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p class = text>As you could see, there are no coins valued less than two United States Dollars. In Rusha, the standard convention is not to charge anything under one Piscel. Also, the United States, or any other country other than the members of the Sheunasiones, does not recognize the Antokasik Rosiyan Natsiya, so currency exchange is impossible. Any money earned as Krazh cannot be converted into foreign money.</p>
